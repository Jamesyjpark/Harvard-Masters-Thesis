HIV positive individuals are living longer but with increased risk for functional decline compared to HIV negative adults of the same age. HIV positive adults are associated with early mortality and premature frailty. Literature suggests that slower walking speed is associated with adverse health outcomes, and faster decrease in walking speed is correlated with worse health outcomes. HIV positive individuals tend to be less active and thus prone to progressive decline in physical function.

We suggest that physical activity monitoring may serve as a useful diagnostic tool sensitive to preclinical risk factors for functional decline in younger and middle-aged individuals that may rectify the limitations of assessing functional capacity and mobility limitations in HIV positive adults through identifying impairment. This study suggests that wearable accelerometers can be used to perform objective assessment of reliable, free-living physical activity that may identify preclinical changes in older HIV positive men. Despite methodological limitations, many studies substantiate strong validity for the measurement of steps from consumer-grade accelerometers compared to laboratory-based measurements and research-grade accelerometers. This study compares walking speed and activity patterns in both HIV positive and negative men in the MATCH cohort by measuring steps taken per minute to estimate gait speed through a consumer-grade accelerometer.
